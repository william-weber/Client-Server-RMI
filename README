DESCRIPTION

This is a simple client and server written in Java using Java's RMI. The client can use multiple threads to simulate multiple simultanous connections to the server, which will create a new thread for every incoming connection.  

COMPILATION
A complete copy of all source files must reside on both client and server machines.

javac Client.java
javac Server.java
rmic CommandExecutor

USAGE
rmiregistry 15432 &
java -Djava.server.rmi.codebase=./ -Djava.security.policy=rmipolicy1.txt Server
java -Djava.security.policy=rmipolicy.txt Client localhost 
java Client hostname

where hostname is the name of the machine the server is running on. If it is the same machine as the client, use localhost. 

The client program offers the user a choice of UNIX commands to run on the server. After the user chooses a command, the client creates a thread which connects to the server and sends it the user's choice. The client will print the answer that it receives from the server (unless the client is in benchmark mode).

The client program can also open multiple simultaneous connections to the server. To do this, choose option 7, Benchmark, from the main menu. It will then prompt for which command to benchmark and how many connections to open. It will calculate and display an average response time for all connections.
